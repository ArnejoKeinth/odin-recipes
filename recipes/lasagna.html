    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat your oven to the temperature specified in your lasagna recipe (usually around 375°F or 190°C).
      </li>

      <li>
        Boil the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions. 
        Add a pinch of salt and a splash of olive oil to the boiling water to prevent sticking. Drain and set aside.
      </li>

      <li>
        In a large skillet or saucepan, heat olive oil over medium heat. 
        Add finely chopped onions and minced garlic, sauté until softened.
      </li>

      <li>
        Add the ground beef (or beef/pork blend) and cook until browned. Drain excess fat.
      </li>

      <li>
        Stir in crushed tomatoes or tomato sauce, dried oregano, dried basil, salt, and black pepper. 
        Simmer the sauce for about 15-20 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.
      </li>

      <li>
        In a separate saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. S
        tir in an equal amount of all-purpose flour to create a roux.
      </li>

      <li>
        Gradually whisk in milk, stirring continuously to avoid lumps. 
        Continue cooking until the sauce thickens. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
      </li>

      <li>
        In a baking dish, start with a thin layer of meat sauce, followed by a layer of lasagna noodles.
      </li>

      <li>
        Spread a portion of béchamel sauce over the noodles, and then add a layer of the lasagna cheese blend.
      </li>

      <li>
        Repeat the layers until you reach the top of the dish, finishing with a generous layer of cheese on top.
      </li>

      <li>
        Cover the baking dish with foil and bake in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes.
      </li>

      <li>
        Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes or until the cheese is golden and bubbly.
      </li>

      <li>
        Allow the lasagna to rest for about 10 minutes before slicing. This helps the layers set and makes it easier to serve. Then serve.
      </li>
    </ol>
